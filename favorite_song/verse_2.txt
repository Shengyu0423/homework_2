I lie for you baby
I die for you baby
Cry for you baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you baby
And only you baby
The things I do baby
But tell me what you've done for me

(Tell me what you've done for me)
Oh, tell me what you've done for me
(Tell me what you've done for me)
Tell me what you've done for me
