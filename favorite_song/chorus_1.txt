I never cheated
Deleted everyone cause they made you uncomfortable
(No oh, oh baby, no)
These accusations
I can't apologize for something that I didn't do
(No oh, oh baby, no)


I won't beg for your love
Won't say please (Oh no, won't say please)
I won't fall to the ground on my knees (on my knees)
You know I've given this everything
Baby honestly, (baby honestly), baby honestly
