Oh, oh


What you thinking?
You think that you could be better off with somebody new
(No oh, oh baby, no)
You say you're leaving
Well if you wanna leave there ain't nobody stopping you
(No oh, oh baby, no)


I won't beg for your love
Won't say please
I won't fall to the ground on my knees
You know I've given this everything
Baby honestly, baby honestly


I lie for you baby
I die for you baby
Cry for you baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you baby
And only you baby
The things I do baby
But tell me what you've done for me


I never cheated
Deleted everyone cause they made you uncomfortable
(No oh, oh baby, no)
These accusations
I can't apologize for something that I didn't do
(No oh, oh baby, no)


I won't beg for your love
Won't say please (Oh no, won't say please)
I won't fall to the ground on my knees (on my knees)
You know I've given this everything
Baby honestly, (baby honestly), baby honestly
